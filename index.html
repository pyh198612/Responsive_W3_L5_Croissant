        <p> A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for
        its historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
        layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. They are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.</p>
